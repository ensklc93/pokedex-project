# The Pokedex Project

This project was initailly created to present my newly learned progamming skills.On the main page, which is also the only one, 250 Pokemon get listed.  When clicked on the Pokemon names, a modal will pop-up and show the details, such as name, height, type and an image of the Pokemon.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to build a small web application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that loads data from an external API and enables the viewing of data points in detail.

## Project Dependencies

In this project I mainly used JavaScript, CSS, HTML. 
As library Bootstrap was used.
For cross-browser compatibility, polyfills were used.
For the Pokemon data, an API from https://pokeapi.co was used.
Finally, with the ESLint and Prettier extensions were used for a consistent & error free code.
