# The Pokedex Project

This project was initially created to present my newly learned programming skills.  On the main page, which is also the only one, 150 Pokemon get listed. When clicked on the Pokemon names, a modal will pop-up and show the details, such as name, height, type and an image of the Pokemon. The application is built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap for a responsive design. Polyfills were implemented for cross-browser compatibility.

You can visit the web page via: [The Pokedex Project Github Pages](https://ensklc93.github.io/pokedex-project/)
