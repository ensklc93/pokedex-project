# The Pokedex Project

This project was initailly created to present my newly learned progamming skills. In the main page, which also is the only one, exist a list of 250 Pokemon. When clicked on the Pokemon names, a Modal will pop-up and show the details, such as name,height, type and an image of the Pokemon.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to build a small web application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that loadsÂ  
data from an external API and enables the viewing of data points in detail.
